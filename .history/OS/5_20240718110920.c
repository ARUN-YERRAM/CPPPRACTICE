// Experiment 5

// Consider the following snapshot of a system. P0, P1, P2, P3, P4 are the processes and A, B, C, D are the resource types. The values in the table indicate the number of instances of a specific resource (for example: 3 3 2 1 under the last column indicates that there are 3 A-type, 3 B-type, 2 C-type, and 1 D-type resources are available after allocating the resources to all five processes). The numbers under allocation-column indicate that those numbers of resources are allocated to various processes mentioned in the first column. The numbers under Max-column indicate the maximum number of resources required by the processes. For example: in 1st row under allocation-column 2 0 0 1 indicate there are 2 A-type, 0 B-type, 0 C-type and 1 D-type resources are allocated to process P0. Whereas 4 2 1 2 under Max-column indicate that process P0â€™s maximum requirement is 4 A-type, 2 B-type, 1 C-type and 2 D-type resources.

// Table:

// Process	Allocation	Max	Available
// P0	2 0 0 1	4 2 1 2	3 3 2 1
// P1	3 1 2 1	5 2 5 2	
// P2	2 1 0 3	2 3 1 6	
// P3	1 3 2 1	1 4 2 4	
// P4	1 4 3 2	3 6 6 5	
// Questions:

// How many instances of resources are present in the system under each type of resource?
// Compute the Need matrix for the given snapshot of a system.
// Verify whether the snapshot of the present system is in a safe state by demonstrating an order in which the processes may complete.
// If a request from process P1 arrives for (1,1,0,0), can the request be granted immediately?
// If a request from process P4 arrives for (0,0,2,0), can the request be granted immediately?
