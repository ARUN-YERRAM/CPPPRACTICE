class Node{Input:
       1
     /   \
    3     2
Output: 3 1 2
Explanation:
First case represents a tree with 3 nodes
and 2 edges where root is 1, left child of
1 is 3 and right child of 1 is 2.

Thus nodes of the binary tree will be
printed as such 3 1 2.}
int main() {
    int arr[8] = {1,2,4,5,6,7,8,9};
    Node*root = NULL;
}
